Windows 11 marks a visual evolution of the operating system. We have evolved our design language alongside with Fluent to create a design which is human, universal and truly feels like Windows.

The design principles below have guided us throughout the journey of making Windows the best-in-class implementation of Fluent.

## Effortless

Windows 11 is faster and more intuitive. It's easy to do what you want, with focus and precision.

## Calm

Windows 11 is softer and more decluttered, it fades into the background to help you stay calm and focused. The experience is warm, ethereal and approachable.

## Personal

Windows 11 adapts seamlessly to the way you use your device. It bends and flexes to individual needs and preferences so that you can truly express yourself.

## Familiar

Windows 11 balances a new, refreshed look and feel with the familiarity of the Windows you already know. There is no learning curve, you can pick it up and go.

## Complete + Coherent

Windows 11 offers a visually seamless experience across platforms. You can work in many platforms and still have a consistent Windows experience.

So which one do you choose?
